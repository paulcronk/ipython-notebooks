# ipython-notebooks
Somewhere to put a range of borrowed and adapted ipython notebooks

### Coursera ipynb
This is adapted from http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/03/coursera-data-mining/. This notebook:

- downloads data from 3 free Coursera APIs
- structures this data into 3 dataframes
- indexes each of the dataframes around the ID columns
- creates a function that maps IDs to names
- changes IDs to names in a master dataframe
- looks up additional data on social media sharing from the sharedcount.com API
- orders the master dataframe by the most shared courses
