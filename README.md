Somewhere to put a range of borrowed and adapted ipython notebooks

### Coursera
Adapted from http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/03/coursera-data-mining/
This:

* downloads data from 3 free Coursera APIs
* structures this data into 3 dataframes
3 indexes each of the dataframes around the ID columns
4 creates a function that maps IDs to names
5 changes IDs to names in a master dataframe
6 looks up additional data on social media sharing from the sharedcount.com API
7 orders the master dataframe by the most shared courses
